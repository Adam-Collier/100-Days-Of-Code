### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: January 3rd, Tuesday

**Todays progress**: Starting to understand how to use objects in arrays!

### Day 2: January 4th, Wednesday

**Todays progress**: Utilised objects in my code using their property values to manipulate the DOM on a button click. Also used the twitter API to generate a pre prepared tweet using a quote from the array of objects.

**Thoughts**: Really starting to understand objects and how they can be used to manipulate the DOM. Would like to experiment with much larger quantities of data.

### Day 3: January 5th, Thursday

**Todays progress**: Completed all of the freecodecamp challenges I had skipped early on in HTML & CSS. Edited Harry's portfolio website to center the image a little more and the responsivity on Ipad.

**Thoughts**: Almost didnt do any coding today. It was a good feeling once the hour was done and I had made some progress.

### Day 4: January 6th, Friday

**Todays progress**: Started the local weather project on FreeCodeCamp, signed up to Codewars and completed several of the challenges

**Thoughts**: Very frustrating day with the local weather project. Struggled to get the geolocation API to work and the latitude and longitude variables to console.log() outside of the local scope of the function. Fetch isnt supported for safari so I am going to use $.getJSON to get the data from the weather API.

### Day 5: January 7th, Saturday

**Todays progress**: Made progress on the weather challenge on FreeCodeCamp. The geolocation API is now working since all of the code was relocated into the local scope of the callback. Also integrated the unsplash API to access images to be used for the background, representional of the current weather conditions.

**Thoughts**: Having a few problems with the geolocations API not working for other people. Have a feeling it is an issue with codepen. Hopefully there wont be any issues when the project is uploaded and tested on github.

### Day 6: January 8th, Sunday

**Todays progress**: Completed the weather project on FreeCodeCamp. Changed the geolocation API to using an IP API to get the nearest city. Started looking into the Wikipedia viewer task and how to go about using their API to display search results. 

**Thoughts**: Because the openweather API didnt use a secure connection Github Pages wouldnt allow the GET request to the API. However it works fine on codepen. Currently unsure about how to tackle the Wikipedia viewer and will have to look into how to use an input to call a function or begin a GET request to POST the search query results to the page.

### Day 7: January 9th, Monday

**Todays progress**: Finished Harry's portfolio site. Centered the image, made the text slightly bigger, added more images and added arrows to add direction to the carousel of images. 

**Thoughts**: Pretty good day with no major drawbacks or problems. Nice feeling to completely understand what I am doing and being in a position where I am looking for ways to improve and push myself. Excited to start working on the wiki viewer.

### Day 8: January 10th, Tuesday

**Todays progress**: Started doing some kata's on Codewars. Managed to do a few without googling but also used the read-search-ask technique when I got stuck. 

**Thoughts**: Surprised at some of the information and processes I am starting to retain and remember. Getting more confident using the methods on arrays and strings. Didn't have enough time to hand to start the Wiki Viewer.

### Day 9: January 11th, Wednesday

**Todays progress**: Continued with some Kata's on Codewars. A clan has been set up for FCC Manchester to add that element of competitiveness. Harry had a few changes for his website so I did that for him. 

**Thoughts**: Annoyed that again I didnt get the time to properly sit down and focus on the Wiki Viewer challenge.

### Day 10: January 12th, Thursday

**Todays progress**: Completed several Kata's to test some of my knowledge. Began the Wiki viewer challenge on FreeCodeCamp, not made particularly lots of progress. 

**Thoughts**: The Wiki API is quite difficult to get my head around. Maybe if I look at it with fresh eyes tomorrow it will all start to fall into place.

### Day 11: January 13th, Friday

**Todays progress**: Starting to get my head around the Wiki API and how to implement it into my Wiki Viewer. Completed a few Kata's to keep challenging the fundamentals.

**Thoughts**: Really need to push myself to get stuck into the Wiki Viewer. On the plus side the my understanding of javascript is getting better with the more Kata's that I do on CodeWars.

### Day 12: January 14th, Saturday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Wiki Viewer with search as you type functionality.

**Thoughts**: Very happy with how my Wiki Viewer has turned out. Using the Google matrial design for the input and keeping it very minimalistic works really well. Probably my proudest moment yet when I finally figured out how to use the API and managed to get it all to work smoothly. However I need to work on my JS indentation to keep it neat and readable.

### Day 13: January 15th, Sunday

**Todays progress**: Started the Twitch TV project on FreeCodeCamp, made a lot of progress using the API. Mainly just styling issues now.

**Thoughts**: Today has been pretty smooth in terms of accessing the array of objects and appending the key values into the DOM. Struggling with the styling a little as I am trying to use flexbox but I'm sure I'll figure it out pretty quickly.

### Day 14: January 16th, Monday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Twitch project on FreeCodeCamp. Manages to successfully make two API calls using $when and $do which allowed me to use the array variable arr. 

**Thoughts**: Pretty happy with how it all turned out. Started the day off frustrated because I couldn't figure out how to access the array variable with the second API call. Another issue came with the adding the error messages to the page but after implementing a couple of if statments it worked a charm. Onwards and upwards.

### Day 15: January 17th, Tuesday

**Todays progress**: Started the Intermediate Algorithm challenges on FreeCodeCamp. The first couple were easy enough, beginning to find higher order functions easier to use and implement into my solutions. 

**Thoughts**: Didnt get a tonne of stuff done today, managed to get a few Kata's in here and there as well as the FreeCodeCamp challenges. Had a look at the Roman Numeral challenge which is my next problem to solve... looks interesting.  

### Day 16: January 18th, Wednesday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Roman Numerals challenge on FreeCodeCamp and added some more images to Harry's portfolio site.  

**Thoughts**: Really struggled to find a starting point on the Roman Numeral challenge and it took a few attempts to understant what I should be doing and how to approach the problem. I am pleased with the result and when looking at other peoples code it is pretty neat and succinct.

### Day 17: January 19th, Thursday

**Todays progress**: Attempted the Where Art Thou challenge on FreeCodeCamp. Struggled a little bit today to make sense of what the problem was asking, I managed to hit two of the objectives to pass but couldnt quite figure out why the other objectives wouldnt pass too.    

**Thoughts**: Instead of using the higher order functions maybe use a for loop? The problem may be that it can map through the objects in the array but not the source key value pairs.

### Day 18: January 20th, Friday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Wherefore Art Thou and Search and Replace challenge on FreeCodeCamp. After writing down the problem to Wherefore Art Thou and breaking it down I was able to approach the problem better and generate a solution.

**Thoughts**: It was a challenge to wrap my head around the first problem but once I got past that barrier I felt a lot more confident. I have looked at some other peoples code and how they have tackled the problem which has been great for future reference.

### Day 19: January 21st, Saturday

**Todays progress**: Started the Pig Latin challenge on FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: Really didnt manage to get much today due to other commitments and working. Hopefully tomorrow will be a lot more productive!

### Day 20: January 22nd, Sunday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Pig Latin challenge on FreeCodeCamp and expanded my knowledge about scope and closures by reading few chapter of You Dont Know JS. 

**Thoughts**: Managed to get three of the four tests passed pretty quickly. It was only when there were several consonants at the beginning that I had to rethink my strategy. I decided to use search method on a string using a regular expression of vowels to get the first index of a vowel then as long as the index wasn't 0 I could splice, join and concatenate them to the end of the string.

### Day 21: January 23rd, Monday

**Todays progress**: Completed the DNA Pairing, Missing Letters, Boo Who and Sorted Union challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Very happy with how much progress has been made today, I have surprised myself how easy it is all starting to feel now. The only issue I have is thinking about where to start, once I start writing code it is fine. Maybe I could go back into my code and start to refactor it using more higher order functions rather than for loops and if statements. Good day all in all. 

### Day 22: January 24th, Tuesday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Convert HTML Entities, Spinal Tap Case and Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers challenges on FreeCodeCamp. Made a start on Sum All Prime Numbers.

**Thoughts**: Today went pretty well. I managed to use quite a few higher order functions which really made my code short and concise. In using Regex in one of the challenged I have a much better understanding of how to use it with parenthesis and $ signs as an argument in a replace method. Started the Sum All Primes challenge but at the moment I am unsure on how to get all of the prime numbers, I am thinking of using a nested for loop but whether that will work we will have to see. 

### Day 23: January 25th, Wednesday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Sum All Primes challenge on FreeCodeCamp. Used a mixture of higher order functions and for loops.

**Thoughts**: Very glad to see the back of that challenge. That was one of the most frustrating challenges I have done upto this point. After many failed attempts of using nested for loops I turned to using higher order functions and I seemed to understand what I was doing a lot more. It involved a little more work but I managed to get there in the end. Its in these situations where I'm glad I go through the struggle stage because on completing the challenge its a great feeling. I think I'll make a page on here recording all of my code from the FreeCodeCamp challenges since it would all be lost if I emptied my cache.
