### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: January 3rd, Tuesday

**Todays progress**: Starting to understand how to use objects in arrays!

### Day 2: January 4th, Wednesday

**Todays progress**: Utilised objects in my code using their property values to manipulate the DOM on a button click. Also used the twitter API to generate a pre prepared tweet using a quote from the array of objects.

**Thoughts**: Really starting to understand objects and how they can be used to manipulate the DOM. Would like to experiment with much larger quantities of data.

### Day 3: January 5th, Thursday

**Todays progress**: Completed all of the freecodecamp challenges I had skipped early on in HTML & CSS. Edited Harry's portfolio website to center the image a little more and the responsivity on Ipad.

**Thoughts**: Almost didnt do any coding today. It was a good feeling once the hour was done and I had made some progress.

### Day 4: January 6th, Friday

**Todays progress**: Started the local weather project on FreeCodeCamp, signed up to Codewars and completed several of the challenges

**Thoughts**: Very frustrating day with the local weather project. Struggled to get the geolocation API to work and the latitude and longitude variables to console.log() outside of the local scope of the function. Fetch isnt supported for safari so I am going to use $.getJSON to get the data from the weather API.

### Day 5: January 7th, Saturday

**Todays progress**: Made progress on the weather challenge on FreeCodeCamp. The geolocation API is now working since all of the code was relocated into the local scope of the callback. Also integrated the unsplash API to access images to be used for the background, representional of the current weather conditions.

**Thoughts**: Having a few problems with the geolocations API not working for other people. Have a feeling it is an issue with codepen. Hopefully there wont be any issues when the project is uploaded and tested on github.

### Day 6: January 8th, Sunday

**Todays progress**: Completed the weather project on FreeCodeCamp. Changed the geolocation API to using an IP API to get the nearest city. Started looking into the Wikipedia viewer task and how to go about using their API to display search results.

**Thoughts**: Because the openweather API didnt use a secure connection Github Pages wouldnt allow the GET request to the API. However it works fine on codepen. Currently unsure about how to tackle the Wikipedia viewer and will have to look into how to use an input to call a function or begin a GET request to POST the search query results to the page.

### Day 7: January 9th, Monday

**Todays progress**: Finished Harry's portfolio site. Centered the image, made the text slightly bigger, added more images and added arrows to add direction to the carousel of images.

**Thoughts**: Pretty good day with no major drawbacks or problems. Nice feeling to completely understand what I am doing and being in a position where I am looking for ways to improve and push myself. Excited to start working on the wiki viewer.

### Day 8: January 10th, Tuesday

**Todays progress**: Started doing some kata's on Codewars. Managed to do a few without googling but also used the read-search-ask technique when I got stuck.

**Thoughts**: Surprised at some of the information and processes I am starting to retain and remember. Getting more confident using the methods on arrays and strings. Didn't have enough time to hand to start the Wiki Viewer.

### Day 9: January 11th, Wednesday

**Todays progress**: Continued with some Kata's on Codewars. A clan has been set up for FCC Manchester to add that element of competitiveness. Harry had a few changes for his website so I did that for him.

**Thoughts**: Annoyed that again I didnt get the time to properly sit down and focus on the Wiki Viewer challenge.

### Day 10: January 12th, Thursday

**Todays progress**: Completed several Kata's to test some of my knowledge. Began the Wiki viewer challenge on FreeCodeCamp, not made particularly lots of progress.

**Thoughts**: The Wiki API is quite difficult to get my head around. Maybe if I look at it with fresh eyes tomorrow it will all start to fall into place.

**Link to work**: [Wiki Viewer](http://codepen.io/AdamCollier/pen/apNMNq)

### Day 11: January 13th, Friday

**Todays progress**: Starting to get my head around the Wiki API and how to implement it into my Wiki Viewer. Completed a few Kata's to keep challenging the fundamentals.

**Thoughts**: Really need to push myself to get stuck into the Wiki Viewer. On the plus side the my understanding of javascript is getting better with the more Kata's that I do on CodeWars.

### Day 12: January 14th, Saturday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Wiki Viewer with search as you type functionality.

**Thoughts**: Very happy with how my Wiki Viewer has turned out. Using the Google matrial design for the input and keeping it very minimalistic works really well. Probably my proudest moment yet when I finally figured out how to use the API and managed to get it all to work smoothly. However I need to work on my JS indentation to keep it neat and readable.

### Day 13: January 15th, Sunday

**Todays progress**: Started the Twitch TV project on FreeCodeCamp, made a lot of progress using the API. Mainly just styling issues now.

**Thoughts**: Today has been pretty smooth in terms of accessing the array of objects and appending the key values into the DOM. Struggling with the styling a little as I am trying to use flexbox but I'm sure I'll figure it out pretty quickly.

### Day 14: January 16th, Monday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Twitch project on FreeCodeCamp. Manages to successfully make two API calls using $when and $do which allowed me to use the array variable arr.

**Thoughts**: Pretty happy with how it all turned out. Started the day off frustrated because I couldn't figure out how to access the array variable with the second API call. Another issue came with the adding the error messages to the page but after implementing a couple of if statments it worked a charm. Onwards and upwards.

### Day 15: January 17th, Tuesday

**Todays progress**: Started the Intermediate Algorithm challenges on FreeCodeCamp. The first couple were easy enough, beginning to find higher order functions easier to use and implement into my solutions.

**Thoughts**: Didnt get a tonne of stuff done today, managed to get a few Kata's in here and there as well as the FreeCodeCamp challenges. Had a look at the Roman Numeral challenge which is my next problem to solve... looks interesting.  

### Day 16: January 18th, Wednesday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Roman Numerals challenge on FreeCodeCamp and added some more images to Harry's portfolio site.  

**Thoughts**: Really struggled to find a starting point on the Roman Numeral challenge and it took a few attempts to understant what I should be doing and how to approach the problem. I am pleased with the result and when looking at other peoples code it is pretty neat and succinct.

### Day 17: January 19th, Thursday

**Todays progress**: Attempted the Where Art Thou challenge on FreeCodeCamp. Struggled a little bit today to make sense of what the problem was asking, I managed to hit two of the objectives to pass but couldnt quite figure out why the other objectives wouldnt pass too.    

**Thoughts**: Instead of using the higher order functions maybe use a for loop? The problem may be that it can map through the objects in the array but not the source key value pairs.

### Day 18: January 20th, Friday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Wherefore Art Thou and Search and Replace challenge on FreeCodeCamp. After writing down the problem to Wherefore Art Thou and breaking it down I was able to approach the problem better and generate a solution.

**Thoughts**: It was a challenge to wrap my head around the first problem but once I got past that barrier I felt a lot more confident. I have looked at some other peoples code and how they have tackled the problem which has been great for future reference.

### Day 19: January 21st, Saturday

**Todays progress**: Started the Pig Latin challenge on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Really didnt manage to get much today due to other commitments and working. Hopefully tomorrow will be a lot more productive!

### Day 20: January 22nd, Sunday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Pig Latin challenge on FreeCodeCamp and expanded my knowledge about scope and closures by reading few chapter of You Dont Know JS.

**Thoughts**: Managed to get three of the four tests passed pretty quickly. It was only when there were several consonants at the beginning that I had to rethink my strategy. I decided to use search method on a string using a regular expression of vowels to get the first index of a vowel then as long as the index wasn't 0 I could splice, join and concatenate them to the end of the string.

### Day 21: January 23rd, Monday

**Todays progress**: Completed the DNA Pairing, Missing Letters, Boo Who and Sorted Union challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Very happy with how much progress has been made today, I have surprised myself how easy it is all starting to feel now. The only issue I have is thinking about where to start, once I start writing code it is fine. Maybe I could go back into my code and start to refactor it using more higher order functions rather than for loops and if statements. Good day all in all.

### Day 22: January 24th, Tuesday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Convert HTML Entities, Spinal Tap Case and Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers challenges on FreeCodeCamp. Made a start on Sum All Prime Numbers.

**Thoughts**: Today went pretty well. I managed to use quite a few higher order functions which really made my code short and concise. In using Regex in one of the challenged I have a much better understanding of how to use it with parenthesis and $ signs as an argument in a replace method. Started the Sum All Primes challenge but at the moment I am unsure on how to get all of the prime numbers, I am thinking of using a nested for loop but whether that will work we will have to see.

### Day 23: January 25th, Wednesday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Sum All Primes challenge on FreeCodeCamp. Used a mixture of higher order functions and for loops.

**Thoughts**: Very glad to see the back of that challenge. That was one of the most frustrating challenges I have done upto this point. After many failed attempts of using nested for loops I turned to using higher order functions and I seemed to understand what I was doing a lot more. It involved a little more work but I managed to get there in the end. Its in these situations where I'm glad I go through the struggle stage because on completing the challenge its a great feeling. I think I'll make a page on here recording all of my code from the FreeCodeCamp challenges since it would all be lost if I emptied my cache.

### Day 24: January 26th, Thursday

**Todays progress**: Started the Smallest Common Multiple on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: This challenge seems to have a lot more to it thatn I first anticipated. There is always a risk of an infite loop since you cant put a limit on the max number because you may have numbers passed in the argument which have a least common multiple past that limit. At the moment I have tried using indexOf in a while loop but it keeps on producing an infinite loop. Going to have to get a pen and paper out and really think this one through.

### Day 25: January 28th, Saturday

**Todays progress**: Attempted the Smallest Common Multiple challenge on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: This is definitely the hardest challenge I have had to do on FreeCodeCamp upto this point. May have to move onto a different challenge and come back to it later on with a fresh mind.

### Day 26: January 29th, Sunday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Finders Keepers, Drop it and Steamroller challenge on FreeCodeCamp. Also watched some videos and read some explanations and examples on recursion and how to use it.

**Thoughts**: The Finders Keepers and Drop It challenge were pretty easy to get my head around so I found the solutions to those pretty easy. When I came to Steamroller I could reduce two dimensional arrays pretty easy but nothing above that. After a lot of searching I realised that I could use recursion in a for loop. I still don't fully understand how recursion works so I will read more explanations and examples. Im not feeling particularly strong with the Maths based challenges at the moment and since my interview with Sky Im thinking I should maybe invest more time looking into node, express and react.

### Day 27: January 30th, Monday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Binary Agents and the Everything be True challenges on FreeCodeCamp. Created a new Markdown file documenting all of my solutions from the Intermediate Algorithm challenges on FreeCodeCamp. That way I know all of my solutions aren't lost if I decide to empty the cache on my browser. Switched my text editor from Sublime Text to Atom, so far so good.

**Thoughts**: Today went pretty smoothly which was a nice change from the past few days which have been relatively tough. As soon as I realised I could use parseInt in the Binary Agents challenge coming up with the solution was straight forward. But thats the thing with programming you have to know what you are looking for, or have some potential methods in mind. I found the Everything be True challenge pretty simple, however I realise now that I could have refactored my code so it was a lot shorter, but passing is still one step forward.

### Day 28: January 31st, Tuesday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting section on FreeCodeCamp! Looked into currying and recursion for the Arguments Optional challenge. Had some fun using Regular Expressions in the Validate Us Telephone Numbers challenge.

**Thoughts**: Today was eventually a good day. I went through the motions of struggling, finding little steps to move forward and finally understanding and reaching a solution. Understand the use of recursion and currying was a huge challenge today but some videos on YouTube by MPJ did help out a lot. I understand them on a very basic level, it's just a case of familiarizing myself with it so much that it becomes embedded.  

### Day 29: February 1st, Wednesday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Symmetric difference and started the Exact Change challenge on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: It was a very frustrating day today. I had a few hiccups when finding the solution to Symmetric differences because I didn't really understand the problem. I need to make sure I fully understand the problem before I dive into the code finding the solution through trial and error. In the Exact Change challenge I had no idea how to start apart from when one of my peers pointed out the similarities to the Roman Numeral challenge. I have more of an idea how to tackle the problem, I may need to fully figure out my approach before hand though using a pen and paper.

### Day 30: February 2nd, Thursday

**Todays progress**: Completed several Kata's on CodeWars.

**Thoughts**: Didn't get much time to code today due to hanging an exhibition at the Isherwood gallery. Managed to scrape out an hour just before bed. I feel much better now I have managed to write some code.

### Day 31: February 3rd, Friday

**Todays progress**: Completed some more Kata's on CodeWars.

**Thoughts**: Again I didn't get much time to code since I was helping sift through 60 art proposals for a local art programme. However, I am challenging myself with only choosing 6kyu or lower challenges.

### Day 32: February 4th, Saturday

**Todays progress**: Completed some more Kata's on CodeWars, taken the top stop on the FCC clan leaderboard.

**Thoughts**: Slowly getting more and more comfortable tackling the challenges on CodeWars. A lot of the time it is just trying to understand the question!! Really need to think about taking on the Advanced Algorithm challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 33: February 5th, Sunday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Inventory Update and Friendly Date Range challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: After a couple of days of not working on the FreeCodeCamp challenges I thought I would struggle to get back into it. However, I have been able to understand the questions and think of clear and concise solutions. I think completing Kata's on CodeWars has contributed to my improved understanding of the questions and some of the approaches I take to the problems.   

### Day 34: February 6th, Monday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Make A Person Challenge on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Mostly a day of reading up about closures and object constructor functions. It took a while to understand the Make A Person challenge and use the argument in the set methods. Starting to look into node, currently watching videos by The Net Ninja and found a website called nodeschool.io which could be a great resource!

### Day 35: February 7th, Tuesday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Map the Debris challenge on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Made a lot of progress today. I found the questions relatively easy to get my head around, which made it a lot simpler to decide on what approach take. Again I am using a lot of higher order functions, especially the map method which has become a nice alternative to for loops. After today I need to look back at some earlier questions to understand some critical key principles and refactor my code.

### Day 36: February 8th, Wednesday

**Todays progress**: Completed the Pairwise challenge on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: After spending a small frustrating period of time on the Pairwise challenge yesterday, I managed to successfully find a solution. Ill admit it feels a little bit hacky with the final if statement but it passes all of the freecodecamp tests. In hindsight I think using a for loop instead of the map method would have been more appropriate since once the desired values are found the loop can be broken. I think I will try to refactor my code and figure out some other possible solutions.

### Day 37: February 9th, Thursday

**Todays progress**: Refactored my code on FreeCodeCamp. Started creating a To-do application using node.js and express.js.

**Thoughts**: This morning I focused on refactoring my code for the Pairwise challenge. I also looked back into the No Repeat Please challenge which I haven't completed yet. I will get into the right frame of mind and focus on that challenge tomorrow. Carried on watching the node tutorials from The Net Ninja and started to follow along with the node project playlist.

### Day 38: February 10th, Friday

**Todays progress**: Completed my To-do application using node and express using a sandbox Mongodb database on mLab.

**Thoughts**: Although I have completed the tutorial series and become more familiar with using node and express I am still a long way from being able to create my own applications from scratch. Therefore I am going to look at the docs and try and find some more resources which can push my learning even further. I have been recommended nodeschool.io previously so that may be a possible avenue to explore. Overall a good day.
