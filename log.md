### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: January 3rd, Tuesday

**Todays progress**: Starting to understand how to use objects in arrays!

### Day 2: January 4th, Wednesday

**Todays progress**: Utilised objects in my code using their property values to manipulate the DOM on a button click. Also used the twitter API to generate a pre prepared tweet using a quote from the array of objects.

**Thoughts**: Really starting to understand objects and how they can be used to manipulate the DOM. Would like to experiment with much larger quantities of data.

### Day 3: January 5th, Thursday

**Todays progress**: Completed all of the freecodecamp challenges I had skipped early on in HTML & CSS. Edited Harry's portfolio website to center the image a little more and the responsivity on Ipad.

**Thoughts**: Almost didnt do any coding today. It was a good feeling once the hour was done and I had made some progress.

### Day 4: January 6th, Friday

**Todays progress**: Started the local weather project on FreeCodeCamp, signed up to Codewars and completed several of the challenges

**Thoughts**: Very frustrating day with the local weather project. Struggled to get the geolocation API to work and the latitude and longitude variables to console.log() outside of the local scope of the function. Fetch isnt supported for safari so I am going to use $.getJSON to get the data from the weather API.

### Day 5: January 7th, Saturday

**Todays progress**: Made progress on the weather challenge on FreeCodeCamp. The geolocation API is now working since all of the code was relocated into the local scope of the callback. Also integrated the unsplash API to access images to be used for the background, representional of the current weather conditions.

**Thoughts**: Having a few problems with the geolocations API not working for other people. Have a feeling it is an issue with codepen. Hopefully there wont be any issues when the project is uploaded and tested on github.

### Day 6: January 8th, Sunday

**Todays progress**: Completed the weather project on FreeCodeCamp. Changed the geolocation API to using an IP API to get the nearest city. Started looking into the Wikipedia viewer task and how to go about using their API to display search results. 

**Thoughts**: Because the openweather API didnt use a secure connection Github Pages wouldnt allow the GET request to the API. However it works fine on codepen. Currently unsure about how to tackle the Wikipedia viewer and will have to look into how to use an input to call a function or begin a GET request to POST the search query results to the page.

### Day 7: January 9th, Monday

**Todays progress**: Finished Harry's portfolio site. Centered the image, made the text slightly bigger, added more images and added arrows to add direction to the carousel of images. 

**Thoughts**: Pretty good day with no major drawbacks or problems. Nice feeling to completely understand what I am doing and being in a position where I am looking for ways to improve and push myself. Excited to start working on the wiki viewer.

### Day 8: January 10th, Tuesday

**Todays progress**: Started doing some kata's on Codewars. Managed to do a few without googling but also used the read-search-ask technique when I got stuck. 

**Thoughts**: Surprised at some of the information and processes I am starting to retain and remember. Getting more confident using the methods on arrays and strings. Didn't have enough time to hand to start the Wiki Viewer.
